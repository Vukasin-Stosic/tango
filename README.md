## 📝 Description

The binary puzzle is a captivating and logical game that challenges players to solve it through pure reasoning. Although it uses only zeros and ones, the game offers a surprising level of complexity. Be warned: this game can be highly addictive!

1. Each row and column must contain an equal number of zeros and ones.
2. There cannot be more than two consecutive zeros or ones in any row or column.
3. The board starts with a few cells already populated.
